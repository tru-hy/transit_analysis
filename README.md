# Transit Analysis

A work in progress software system for analyzing transit data.
In very early development.


## Getting started

The system currently consists mostly of the database
schema and utilities to dump some data in to the database.

Requires Python 2.x (developed on 2.7), modern version of Postgresql
(developed on 9.2) and a bunch of more or less obscure Python
packages.

### Installation

Get the sources using (modern version of) git (including submodules):

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/tru-hy/transit_analysis.git
    cd transit_analysis

#### Quick

For debian-style distribitions, you can run an installer script that
tries to set the stuff up using default values. You'll need to have
sudo to run it (it'll ask the password as it goes):
   
    ./install.debian.bash

#### Slow

TODO. See what's done in [install.debian.bash](install.debian.bash).

### Import data
