# Transit Analysis

A work in progress software system for analyzing transit data.
In very early development.


## Getting started

The system currently consists mostly of the database
schema and utilities to dump some data in to the database.

Requires Python 2.x (developed on 2.7), modern version of Postgresql
(developed on 9.2) and a bunch of more or less obscure Python
packages.
